## Project Summary
This project serves as a way for users to able to access information about the 2021 Tokyo Olympics easily. Users of our web application will be able to quickly filter through 2021 Tokyo Olympics data and will be able to easily find the information they are looking for. They can also view visual comparisons and graphs of relevant data. For example, the user will be able to see a bar graph of gold medals won by each country, sorted in descending order. Finally, they will be able to participate in our site-wide hurdle competition by playing the game feature we will implement.
